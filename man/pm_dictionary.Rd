\title{Create Dictionary Objects}
\usage{
pm_dictionary(type, append, filter, case = c("title", "lower", "upper"), locale = "us")
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{A string indicating the grammatical address element the dictionary
should represent. Current options are \code{"state"}, \code{"city"},
\code{"directional"}, and \code{"suffix"}.}

\item{append}{An optional dictionary appendix object created with \code{\link{pm_append}}}

\item{filter}{An optional character scalar or vector with output elements that should
be retained. Filter inputs are based on the expected output: states should be specified
with their two-letter abbrevation (i.e. \code{"MO"}), cities should be specified in title
case (i.e. \code{"St. Louis"}), directionals should use one- or two-letter abbreivations
(i.e. \code{"N"}), and street suffixes should use the \code{suf.output} for the desired
suffix (i.e. \code{"Ave"} or \code{"Rd"}).}

\item{case}{An optional character scalar or vector containing one or more of three valid
options - \code{"title"} (e.g. "Missouri"), \code{"lower"} (e.g. "missouri), or
\code{"upper"} (e.g. "MISSOURI"). These are used to create a more robust dictionary of
input terms.}

\item{locale}{A string indicating the country these data represent; the only
current option is \code{"us"} but this is included to facilitate future expansion.}
}
\value{
A \code{postmastr} dictionary object, which will always include an input column
    of possible terms for the given grammatical address element. All dictionary objects
    except for city dictionaries will also contain an output column with the
    preferred output for each input. For American addresses, these outputs follow United States
    Postal Service guidelines.
}
\description{
This function allows for the creation of dictionary objects that are
    either optional or required elements of other \code{postmastr} functions. Once created,
    dictionary objects should not be modified as the formatting of dictionary elements provides
    other \code{postmastr} functions with predictable inputs. The \code{"state"},
    \code{"directional"}, and \code{"suffix"} dictionaries are based on tables that are also
    exported so that they can be previewed and tested.

    Street dictionaries cannot be created using \code{pm_dictionary}. Users who wish to standardize
    street names in their data should create a dictionary appendix with \code{pm_append} and use
    that as the primary dictionary for functions that accept street dictionaries. The same is true
    for house suffix dictionaries.
}
\details{
The city dictionary functionality is powered by the \link[tidycensus]{get_acs} function
    from the \pkg{tidycensus} package. This requires a Census Bureau API key, which can be
    obtained at \url{http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html}. Once you have a key, the
    \link[tidycensus]{census_api_key} function from \pkg{tidycensus} should be used to
    set-up the key before proceeding with the creation of any dictionary objects for cities.

                                        output = c("full", "abbreviation")))

# add custom abbreviation for Massachusetts
## create dictionary appendix
